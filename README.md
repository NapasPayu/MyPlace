# MyPlace

A sample application that allows you to find nearby places based on a location you select on Google Map

Time Estimation

2 hrs - Design app structure with Activities, Fragments, Dagger, View Model, Live Data

3 hrs - Implement Google Map with auto-detected current location and address decoding

3 hrs - Learn about new Google Places SDK and try it out. Finally, I found out that it does not fit the requirement

1 hrs - Switch to Google Places API using Retrofit as a HTTP client

1 hrs - Add database to store places locally
